/* To convert a positive integer to a negative integer, you can just place a 
 * minus sign in front of the variable that contains the integer. However, if 
 * you don't know whether the original value is negative you may inadvertently 
 * convert your variable to the wrong value. You can use the Math.abs method to 
 * simplify matters by forcing a value positive. For this problem, create a 
 * variable with a value of -180, then use Math.abs to log the positive value of 
 * the variable.
