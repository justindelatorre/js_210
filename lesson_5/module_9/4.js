/* Suppose, instead, that we want to calculate the 6th power of a number. We 
 * could multiply a number by itself six times with a function. However, it is 
 * easier to just use Math.pow. Math.pow takes two arguments, the base and the 
 * exponent, and returns the result. Use Math.pow to compute and log the value 
 * of 16 to the 6th power.

console.log(Math.pow(16, 6)); // logs: 16777216
