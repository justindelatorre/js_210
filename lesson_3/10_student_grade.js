// If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then 
// the grade is 'A'
// If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and 
// less than 90 then the grade is 'B'
// If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and 
// less than 70 then the grade is 'C'
// If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'
//
// You may assume that all input values are valid positive 
// integers.
